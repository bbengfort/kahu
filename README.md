# Kahu

**Replica management and monitoring service.**

## About

Kahu is a service that manages replica configurations for my research. Each replica has a small client that uses the Kahu API to report its status as well as receive configuration updates. The Kahu web interface is used to monitor the replicas and push configuration changes for various experiments or applications.
