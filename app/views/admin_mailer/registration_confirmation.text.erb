Dear Kahu Admin,

A user has requested access to <%= @host %>, and needs to be confirmed

- Email: <%= @user.email %>
- Token: <%= @user.email_confirmation_token %>

To confirm this user, please click this link:

<%= confirm_email_url token: @user.email_confirmation_token %>

Or use the provided token to approve the user.

If this email address is unknown, you can ignore confirmation or remove the user from the database.

Yours Truly,
The Kahu Server Bot
